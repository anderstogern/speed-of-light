Calculating the speed of light
------------------------------
The speed of light (*v*), is calculated from the speed of light in vacuume (*c*) and the refractive index (*n*) of air<sup>1</sup> based on the current measures of temperature, relative humidity and atmospheric pressure<sup>2</sup>.
Factors such as the wave length (*λ*) of the standard red helium-neon laser in vacuum and the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the air has not been taken into account (this calculation is valid for *λ*≈633nm and the approximate concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> of 300..600*μ*/mol/mol), although this would yield a more precise calculation of the speed of light.
The included factors are taken from Yahoo!'s weather API<sup>3</sup>.
